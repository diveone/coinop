# CoinOp

Simple cryptocurrency monitor and analyzer. This is an experimental project on building APIs for cryptocurrencies.

## TODO
- Browsable api docs (might be simpler to roll a basic custom solution than manage Swagger):
    * HTML templates (jinja)
    * API routes (docs.py)
    * Embed api responses in templates
- Tests (unittest?)
- Migrations
- Feature: interactive visualizations
- Feature: News API related to each coin
